## Web Languages

The web is a wide and varied place. Many people spend their entire careers in the world of web development. So in this section, we'll be looking at:

-   front end vs back end
-   Front-end languages
-   Back-end languages

### Front End vs. Back End
We just looked at a number if important terms in this video, so let's go over them a bit more. We looked at:

-   the client
-   a server
-   the front end
-   the back end
-   and full stack

When a developer uses the word "client", they could mean the  _person_  that's making a request but, more commonly, "client" is used to refer to the user's  _browser_. Now, in contrast to the "client", there's the "server". A server is just a computer that's waiting to provide information. There's nothing really special about a server. It's just a computer with specific software installed on it. With the right software, you could turn  _your_  computer into a server.

Front end, front-end languages, and front-end development...all of this takes place on the client/browser. The front-end languages are:

-   HTML
-   CSS
-   JavaScript

So a front-end developer is someone that's working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to build what users see on the client (in their browser).

Back end, back-end languages, and back-end development...all of these take place on the server. There are actually  _many_  back-end languages, so we'll look at them more in the Back-end Languages section.

Now, if a developer is working on the front end  _and_  the backend, then they are what's known as a full-stack developer.

### Front-end Languages

## Programming

The notion of "programming" can be a little cryptic if you haven't ever done it before. What exactly does a programmer _do_? How does one  _become_  a programmer? In this section, we'll look at:

-   Syntax
-   Text Editors
-   Programming
-   Estimating how long it takes to "program"

## Standards

Where do programming languages come from? How are they developed? What in the world is a "spec"? We'll look at these questions and others in the following topics:

-   How HTML and CSS are developed
-   How JavaScript is developed
-   How Python is developed

## Version Control

Version Control is incredibly powerful and is used by any programmer that's worth their weight. In the following sections, we'll look at what Version control is, how it works, and other parts of the version control ecosystem. The topics in this section are:

-   Why Version Control is needed
-   How Version Control works
-   Where GitHub fits
-   What a PR is

## Disparate Web Terms

The web is a huge place, and not everything fits neatly into the "front end" or the "back end". There are terms that span both or terms that are tangentially related. In this section on "Disparate Web Terms", we'll be looking at terms and concepts that are in the world of web development but don't fit cleanly in "front end", "back end", or "version control". The topics in this section are:

-   Web Requests
-   Debugging
-   Databases and APIs
-   Markdown vs Markup
-   Libraries and Frameworks
-   CMS
-   Command Line
