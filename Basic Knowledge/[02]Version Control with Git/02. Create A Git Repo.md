# 1. Create A Git Repo From Scratch

## Command: `git init`

Before you can make commits or do anything else with a git repository, the repository needs to actually exist. To create a new repository with Git, we'll use the `git init` command.

The `init` subcommand is short for "initialize", which is helpful because it's the command that will do all of the initial setup of a repository. We'll look at what it does in just a second.

1. Create course directories
	- create a directory called  `udacity-git-course`
	- inside that, create another directory called  `new-git-project`
	- use the  `cd`  command to move into the  `new-git-project`  directory

	> 1. `cd` to where you want these files stored
	> 2. `mkdir -p udacity-git-course/new-git-project && cd $_`

2. Initialize an empty Git repository in the current directory: `git init`

## Effect of `git init`

Running the  `git init`  command sets up all of the necessary files and directories that Git will use to keep track of everything. All of these files are stored in a directory called  `.git`  (notice the  `.`  at the beginning - that means it'll be a hidden directory on Mac/Linux). This  `.git`  directory  _is the "repo"_! This is where git records all of the commits and keeps track of everything!

Let's take a brief look at the contents of the  `.git`  directory.

> WARNING: Don't directly edit any files inside the  `.git`  directory. This is the heart of the repository. If you change file names and/or file content, git will probably lose track of the files that you're keeping in the repo, and you could lose a lot of work! It's okay to look at those files though, but don't edit or delete them.

## .Git Directory Contents

_We're about to take a look at the  `.git`  directory...it's not vital for this course, though, so don't worry about memorizing anything, it's here if you want to dig a little deeper into how Git works under the hood._

Here's a brief synopsis on each of the items in the  `.git`  directory:

-   **config file**  - where all  _project specific_  configuration settings are stored.  
    From the  [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration):  
    
    > Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (.git/config) of whatever repository you’re currently using. These values are specific to that single repository.
    
    For example, let's say you set that the global configuration for Git uses your personal email address. If you want your work email to be used for a specific project rather than your personal email, that change would be added to this file.
    

-   **description file**  - this file is only used by the GitWeb program, so we can ignore it

-   **hooks directory**  - this is where we could place client-side or server-side scripts that we can use to hook into Git's different lifecycle events

-   **info directory**  - contains the global excludes file

-   **objects directory**  - this directory will store all of the commits we make

-   **refs directory**  - this directory holds pointers to commits (basically the "branches" and "tags")

Remember, other than the "hooks" directory, you shouldn't mess with pretty much any of the content in here. The "hooks" directory  _can_  be used to hook into different parts or events of Git's workflow, but that's a more advanced topic that we won't be getting into in this course.

## Git Init Recap

Use the  `git init`  command to create a new, empty repository in the current directory.

```
$ git init

```

Running this command creates a hidden  `.git`  directory. This  `.git`  directory is the brain/storage center for the repository. It holds all of the configuration files and directories and is where all of the commits are stored.

# 2. Clone An Existing Git Repo

## Command: `git init`

## Why Clone?

First, what is cloning?

> to make an identical copy

What's the value of creating an identical copy of something, and how does this relate to Git and version control?

Why would you want to create an identical copy? Well, when I work on a new web project, I do the same set of steps:

-   create an  `index.html`  file
-   create a  `js`  directory
-   create a  `css`  directory
-   create an  `img`  directory
-   create  `app.css`  in the css directory
-   create  `app.js`  in the js directory
-   add starter HTML code in  `index.html`
-   add configuration files for linting (validating code syntax)
    -   [HTML linting](http://htmlhint.com/)
    -   [CSS linting](https://stylelint.io/)
    -   [JavaScript linting](http://eslint.org/)
-   [configure my code editor](http://editorconfig.org/)

...and I do this  _every time_  I create a new project!...which is a lot of effort I'm putting in for each new project. I didn't want to keep doing these same steps over and over, so I did all of the steps listed above one last time and created a starter project for myself. Now when I create a new project, I just make an identical copy of that starter project!

The way that cloning relates to Git is that the command we'll be running on the terminal is  `git clone`. You pass a path (usually a URL) of the Git repository you want to clone to the  `git clone`  command.

Wanna try cloning an existing project? Let's see how Git's  `clone`  command works!

## HINT: Verify Terminal Location

TIP: Now before you clone anything, make sure you are located in the correct directory on the command line. Cloning a project creates a new directory and places the cloned Git repository in it. The problem is that you can't have nested Git repositories. So make sure the terminal's current working directory isn't located in a Git repository. If your current working directory is not in your shell's prompt, type  `pwd`  to print the working directory.

## Cloning The Blog Repository

Ready? Let's get cloning!

The command is  `git clone`  and then you pass the path to the Git repository that you want to clone. The project that we'll be using throughout this course is located at this URL:  [https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project](https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project)  So using this URL, the full command to clone blog project is:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project
```

## Git Clone Output Explanation

Let's look briefly at the output that  `git clone`  displays.

The first line says "Cloning into 'course-git-blog-project'...". Git is creating a directory (with the same name of the project we're cloning) and putting the repository in it...that's pretty cool!

The rest of the output is basically validation - it's counting the remote repository's number of objects, then it compresses and receives them, then it unpacks them.

## Clone Project And Use Different Name

You just cloned the blog project for this course. Awesome job!

The command you ran in the terminal was:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project

```

...which created a directory named  `course-git-blog-project`.

What if you want to use a different name instead of the default one? Yes, you could just run the command above and manually rename it in Finder/Windows Explorer or use  `mv`  on the terminal. But that's too many steps for us! Instead, we'd rather clone the project and have it use a different name all in one go! But how do we do that?

`git clone  https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project blog-project`

## WARNING: Not In A Git Repository?

WARNING: Here's a  _very important_  step that often gets missed when you first start working with Git. When the  `git clone`  command is used to clone a repository, it creates a new directory for the repository...you already know this.  _But, it doesn't change your shell's working directory._  It created the new repo inside the current working directory, which means that the current working directory is still  _outside_  of this new Git repo! Make sure you  `cd`  into the new repository.

Remember to use the Terminal's command prompt as an aid - if you're in a directory that is a Git repository, the command prompt will include a name in parentheses.

## Git Clone Recap

The  `git clone`  command is used to create an identical copy of an existing repository.

```
$ git clone <path-to-repository-to-clone>

```

This command:

-   takes the path to an existing repository
-   by default will create a directory with the same name as the repository that's being cloned
-   can be given a second argument that will be used as the name of the directory
-   will create the new repository inside of the current working directory

## Status Update

At this point, we have two Git repositories:

-   the empty one that we created with the  `git init`  command
-   the one we cloned with the  `git clone`  command

How can we find any information about these repositories? Git's controlling them, but how can we find out what Git knows about our repos? To figure out what's going on with a repository, we use the  `git status`  command. Knowing the status of a Git repository is  _extremely_  important, so head straight on over to the next concept: Determine A Repo's Status.

# 3. Determine A Repo's Status

## Command: `git status`

Working with Git on the command line can be a little bit challenging because it's a little bit like a  [black box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box). I mean, how do you know when you should or shouldn't run certain Git commands? Is Git ready for me to run a command yet? What if I run a command but I think it didn't work...how can I find that out? The answer to all of these questions is the  `git status`  command!

```
$ git status
```

The  `git status`  is our key to the mind of Git. It will tell us what Git is thinking and the state of our repository as Git sees it. When you're first starting out, you should be using the  `git status`  command  __all of the time__! Seriously. You should get into the habit of running it after any other command. This will help you learn how Git works and it'll help you from making (possibly) incorrect assumptions about the state of your files/repository.

## Git Status Output

The  `git status`  command will display a lot of information depending on the state of your files, the working directory, and the repository. You don't need to worry too much about these, though...just run  `git status`  and it will display the information you need to know.

[](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud123/lessons/437a88fc-15f5-48b8-a6a5-0cf3347e6183/concepts/ce648229-7d6c-4ad3-805e-af6a77f38fd0#)

![An animated gif of the Terminal application. The `git status` command is run in the `course-git-blog-project` project.](https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2017/February/589a6434_ud123-l2-git-status-blog-project/ud123-l2-git-status-blog-project.gif)

_An animated gif of the Terminal application. The  `git status`  command is run in the  `course-git-blog-project`  project._

## Git Status Explanation

As you can see in the GIF above, running  `git status`  in the  `course-git-blog-project`  project produces the following output:

```
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean

```

The output tells us two things:

1.  `On branch master`  – this tells us that Git is on the  `master`  branch. You've got a description of a branch on your terms sheet so this is the "master" branch (which is the default branch). We'll be looking more at branches in lesson 5
2.  `Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.`  – Because  `git clone`  was used to copy this repository from another computer, this is telling us if our project is in sync with the one we copied from. We won't be dealing with the project on the other computer, so this line can be ignored.
3.  `nothing to commit, working directory clean`  – this is saying that there are no pending changes.

Think of this output as the "resting state" (that's not an official description - it's how I like to describe it!). This is the resting state because there are no new files, no changes have been made in files, nothing is in the staging area about to be committed...no change or action is pending, so that's why I like to call it the resting state.

So this is what it looks like when running  `git status`  in a repository that already has commits. Let's switch to the  `new-git-project`  project to see what the  `git status`  output will produce.

> ### 💡 Changes in Git v2.14 💡

> In Git version 2.14, running the  `git status`  command in an empty directory changed the wording of "Inital commit" to the much clearer "No commits yet". So the output would be:

> ```
> On branch master
> 
> No commits yet
> 
> nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
> ```

## Explanation Of Git Status In A New Repo

This is the output of running  `git status`  in the  `new-git-project`  project:

```
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)

```

To be completely clear, I haven't made any commits in my project yet. If you have made a commit, then your output should look exactly like that of the course-git-blog-project project.

If you compare this to the  `git status`  output from the course-git-blog-project project, then you'll see that they're pretty similar. The thing to note that's different is that this output includes the line  `Initial commit`. This is the tiniest bit confusing because there actually aren't any commits in this repository yet! We haven't discussed making a commit yet, but when we do, we will be able to make an initial commit.

Wanna have a sneak peak of the next lesson and at the same time prove that there aren't any commits in this repo yet? Great, I knew you did! Try running the command  `git log`  and check out its response:

```
$ git log
fatal: your current branch 'master' does not have any commits yet

```

Well, that's kind of scary looking. "Fatal"? Fortunately, it turns out that just means that the Git program is exiting because it can't find any work to do. Git tells us this as if it were an error, but it's really not a problem. We know we haven't put any commits into this repo yet.

It's pretty clear from the response that there aren't any commits!

We've just taken a very brief look at the  `git status`  command. Remember that the output of  `git status`  will change depending on if files have been added/deleted/modified, what's on the staging index, and the state of the repository. We'll be using the  `git status`  command throughout this entire course, so get comfortable running it!

## Git Status Recap

The  `git status`  command will display the current status of the repository.

```
$ git status

```

I can't stress enough how important it is to use this command  _all the time_  as you're first learning Git. This command will:

-   tell us about new files that have been created in the Working Directory that Git hasn't started tracking, yet
-   files that Git  _is_  tracking that have been modified
-   a whole bunch of other things that we'll be learning about throughout the rest of the course ;-)

# 4. Display A Repo's Commits

## Command: `git log`

By  _default_, this command displays:

-   the SHA
-   the author
-   the date
-   and the message

### Navigating The Log

If you're not used to a pager on the command line, navigating in  [Less](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Less_(Unix))  can be a bit odd. Here are some helpful keys:

-   to scroll  **down**, press
    -   `j`  or  `↓`  to move  _down_  one line at a time
    -   `d`  to move by half the page screen
    -   `f`  to move by a whole page screen
-   to scroll  **up**, press
    -   `k`  or  `↑`  to move _up_ one line at a time
    -   `u`  to move by half the page screen
    -   `b`  to move by a whole page screen
-   press  `q`  to  **quit**  out of the log (returns to the regular command prompt)
-   `/` for search

We've been looking closely at all the detailed information that  `git log`  displays. But now, take a step back and look at all of the information as a whole.

## Flag: `--oneline`
### Command: `git log --oneline`

### Know-how
Let's think about some of these questions:
-   **the SHA**  -  `git log`  will display the complete SHA for every single commit. Each SHA is unique, so we don't really need to see the  _entire_  SHA. We could get by perfectly fine with knowing just the first 6-8 characters. Wouldn't it be great if we could save some space and show just the first 5 or so characters of the SHA?
-   **the author**  - the  `git log`  output displays the commit author for  _every single commit_! It could be different for other repositories that have multiple people collaborating together, but for this one, there's only one person making all of the commits, so the commit author will be identical for all of them. Do we need to see the author for each one? What if we wanted to hide that information?
-   **the date**  - By default,  `git log`  will display the date for each commit. But do we really care about the commit's date? Knowing the date might be important occasionally, but typically knowing the date isn't vitally important and can be ignored in a lot of cases. Is there a way we could hide that to save space?
-   **the commit message**  - this is one of the most important parts of a commit message...we usually always want to see this

What could we do here to not waste a lot of space and make the output smaller? We can use a  **flag**.

> TIP: This isn't a course on the command line, but a flag is used to alter how a program functions. For example, the  `ls`  command will list all of the files in the current directory. The  `ls`  command has a  `-l`  flag (i.e.  `ls -l`) that runs the same  `ls`  command but alters how it works; it now displays the information in the  _long_  format (the  `-l`  for  _long_).

> Flags can be used to alter how a program functions and/or what is displayed. To learn more about command line programs and flags, check out our course  [Linux Command Line Basics](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595).

The  `git log`  command has a flag that can be used to alter how it displays the repository's information. That flag is  `--oneline`:

```
$ git log --oneline
```

Check out how different the output is!

### Recap

To recap, the  `--oneline`  flag is used to alter how  `git log`  displays information:

```
$ git log --oneline
```

This command:

-   lists one commit per line
-   shows the first 7 characters of the commit's SHA
-   shows the commit's message

## Flag: `--stat`
### Command: `git log --stat`

The `git log` command has a flag that can be used to display the files that have been changed in the commit, as well as the number of lines that have been added or deleted. The flag is `--stat` ("stat" is short for "statistics"):

This command:

-   displays the file(s) that have been modified
-   displays the number of lines that have been added/removed
-   displays a summary line with the total number of modified files and lines that have been added/removed
Run this command and check out what it displays.

## Flag: `-p`/`--patch`

### Viewing Changes

We know that  `git log`  will show us the commits in a repository, and if we add the  `--stat`  flag, we can see what files were modified and how many lines of code were added or removed. Wouldn't it be awesome if we could see exactly  _what those changes were_?

If this isn't the best part of a version control system, I don't know what is! Being able to see the exact changes that were made to a file is incredibly important! Being able to say, "oh, ok, so this commit adds 5 pixels of border-radius to the button!".

For example, in the blog project, the commit  `a3dc99a`  has the message "center content on page" and modifies the CSS file by adding 5 lines. What are those five lines that were added? How can we figure out what those 5 lines are?

### Command: `git log -p`/`git log --patch` 

The  `git log`  command has a flag that can be used to display the actual changes made to a file. The flag is  `--patch`  which can be shortened to just  `-p`:

```
$ git log -p
```

This command adds the following to the default output:

-   displays the files that have been modified
-   displays the location of the lines that have been added/removed
-   displays the actual changes that have been made

Run this command and check out what it displays.

### Annotated  `git log -p`  Output

Using the image above, let's do a quick recap of the  `git log -p`  output:

-   🔵 - the file that is being displayed
-   🔶 - the hash of the first version of the file and the hash of the second version of the file
    -   not usually important, so it's safe to ignore
-   ❤️ - the old version and current version of the file
-   🔍 - the lines where the file is added and how many lines there are
    -   `-15,83`  indicates that the old version (represented by the  `-`) started at line 15 and that the file had 83 lines
    -   `+15,85`  indicates that the current version (represented by the  `+`) starts at line 15 and that there are now 85 lines...these 85 lines are shown in the patch below
-   ✏️ - the actual changes made in the commit
    -   lines that are red and start with a minus (`-`) were in the original version of the file but have been removed by the commit
    -   lines that are green and start with a plus (`+`) are new lines that have been added in the commit

### Further Research

-   [Generating patches with -p](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#_generating_patches_with_p)  from the Git docs

### Command: `git log -p --stat`

it displays both with the stat info and above the patch info

## Flag: `-w`

In the video above, we looked at a commit that indents a lot of code. The patch output shows all of those lines as having been removed and then added again at their new level of indentation. Showing all of the indent changes makes it hard to tell what was actually added, though.

What does the  `-w`  flag do to the patch information? For help, check  [this Git docs page](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff).
    
-   it ignores whitespace changes

Command: `git log -p --stat -w`

## Command:  `git show`

The other command that shows a specific commit is  `git show`:

```
$ git show
```

Running it like the example above will only display the most recent commit. Typically, a SHA is provided as a final argument:

```
$ git show fdf5493
```

### What does  `git show`  do?

The  `git show`  command will show  _only one commit_. So don't get alarmed when you can't find any other commits - it only shows one. The output of the  `git show`  command is exactly the same as the  `git log -p`  command. So by default,  `git show`  displays:

-   the commit
-   the author
-   the date
-   the commit message
-   the patch information

However,  `git show`  can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:

-   `--stat`  - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were added/removed
-   `-p`  or  `--patch`  - this the default, but if  `--stat`  is used, the patch won't display, so pass  `-p`  to add it again
-   `-w`  - to ignore changes to whitespace
